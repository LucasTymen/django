Templates
Conditionals in Templates

Now that we have covered variables, we can start using if statements.
These if statements help customize web pages without having to create separate templates for different instances.
Imagine if we have an application that shows information for different US cities.
Making individual templates for each city could take ages! Instead, we can use if statements to determine what city’s information to display.

An if statement in DTL is very similar to Python if statements.
However, they consist of two necessary components and two optional components. The major components are:

    An if keyword is used in every if statement and its purpose is the same as in Python.
    An endif keyword is used to let DTL know that we are at the end of the if statement.

The two optional components are:

    elif - which is used if we want to check more than one condition within the if statement.
    else - which will execute whenever the if and all elifs evaluates as false. It will be the last thing included in an if statement before the endif.

To add an if statement to the template, we’ll need to set it up inside of tags.
Remember, tags are the {% and %} symbols we used earlier for extending our base template to other templates.
Generally, tags are used to tell the DTL that an expression needs to be executed or evaluated.
There is no need to use separate variable tags when accessing a variable in normal tags.
For instance, if we wanted to display attractions for New York or Los Angeles, we could use the following conditional:

{% if city.name == "New York" %}
  <p>Attractions for New York City are</p>
  ...
{% elif city.name == "Los Angeles" %}
  <p>Attractions for Los Angeles are</p>
  ...
{% else %}
  <p>We currently do not have any attractions for that city</p>
{% endif %}

Notice that we can use the same {% %} tags to create these conditionals within the template, and help tell the DTL what to render.
This makes sure that only certain elements get rendered based off the conditionals detailed.

Other conditionals can be used other than just ==. Any conditional that is conventionally used with Python conditional statements.
Lessons are available if you want refresher on conditionals.
Instructions
1.

In the content block, create an if statement that checks if the pet.animal_type is "Dog".
Inside the if statement, render a <p> that says The animal is a dog.
2.

After the if statement, add an elif statement to the if statement that checks to see if the animal type is "Cat".
If it is, have a <p> that says The animal is a cat.

The elif tag should say {% elif pet.animal_type == "Cat" %}.
3.

After the elif, create an else statement that renders a <p> that says The animal is not a dog or cat.

The tag with the else statement should only say else.
4.

After the else, end the if statement by adding an endif tag.

The endif tag should go after the output of the else and before the endblock.
