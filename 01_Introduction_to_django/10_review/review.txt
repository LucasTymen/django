Creating Your First Django App
Review

Great! We just built a simple web application with Django.
When we start up the development server, we will see a welcome message displayed when we navigate to localhost in the browser!

In this lesson, we learned a lot about Django and how it simplifies making a dynamic database-driven web application. We learned:

    How to use django-admin to start a project
    startproject command automatically configures default applications and a browser
    How to use the startapp command to create a Django app
    How to install the app to the list of INSTALLED_APPS
    How to write a view function to return a template with context
    How to wire a view function to a URL for us to see

In the following lessons, we’ll learn more features of the Django web framework to build robust web applications.
Next, we’ll learn how to use additional syntax to make our templates more dynamic.
Instructions

Start Django’s development server on port 4001 and visit the homepage of our app in the browser at localhost.
Try adding another view function for our app or adding additional contexts to the template file.
