Creating Your First Django App
Starting a Django Project

Now that we have a basic understanding of what Django is and how it works, let’s get started with creating a project.
Django provides us with django-admin, a command-line utility that helps us with a variety of administrative tasks.
We can use it with various commands by calling it in the terminal like this:

django-admin <command> [options]

Running django-admin help will provide a list of possible commands.

A Django project can be easily created with the startproject command.
It takes a couple of options– the name of the project and optionally the directory for our project.
The full command would look like this:

django-admin startproject projectname

Django will then create a directory for the project, or the project root folder.

my-project/
  ├── my-project/
  └── manage.py

Inside the project root folder is a Python file, manage.py, that contains a collection of useful functions used to administer the project.
This file performs the same actions as django-admin but is set specifically to the project. We can do a number of things with it, such as starting a server.

Alongside the manage.py is another directory with the same name as the project.
This folder is treated as a Python package because of the presence of __init__.py, and inside this directory contains important settings and configuration files for the project.

We’ll start a project in this exercise, and in the next exercise we will go into more detail about the specific files that are created.
Instructions
1.

Start a Django project called djangovet using the django-admin utility in the terminal.
2.

View the project directory that was created inside the file explorer.
Click on the button the folder at the top left hand corner of the code editor expand the menu or select “Open file”.
After you’ve explored the files, click “Check work” to pass this step and move on to the next exercise.

Open up the folder djangovet in the file explorer.
