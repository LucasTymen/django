Creating Your First Django App
Introduction to Django

Welcome to the world of Django!

Django, pronounced like JANG-go with a silent D, is a high-level web framework that is written with Python — one of the most readable and beginner-friendly programming languages.
Django can be used to rapidly build complex database-driven websites.
Like Python, Django is often considered to be strongly opinionated.
An opinionated software has guidelines and defaults, such as code structure, project structure, for developing code.
Django’s opinionated approach means specific ways of writing code and a steeper learning curve to apply the “Django philosophy“.

However, it comes with advantages when onboarding new teammates to a project and debugging code because of how structured a Django project is.

Django is an open-source project, supported by the Django Software Foundation, and has a strong community of contributors.

It has been used by many well-known data-heavy websites such as Instagram, Youtube, and Dropbox.
In this lesson, we’ll create together our first Django app! More importantly, we’ll experience first-hand how its design helps to take applications from concept to completion using its “batteries included” approach.
