Creating Your First Django App
What is a Web Framework?

Let’s first establish what it means when we say Django is a web framework.

Web frameworks are a type of software development tool that makes it easier and faster to develop web applications.
They are a type of code library that provides code and patterns for database access, as well as templating systems for content.
They promote code reuse, so we don’t have to write as much code to get a project running. Some features most web frameworks include are:

    URL routing
    Input form management and validation
    Templating engines for HTML and CSS
    Database configuration
    Web security
    Session repository and retrieval

Out of the box, Django comes with an admin panel, a user authentication system, a database, and something called object-relational mapper (ORM) that helps a web application interact with a database.
These are some of the “batteries” included in Django to help build projects faster without having to worry about which tools to use.

Later we’ll see how we can bootstrap a fully featured web application in only a handful of commands.
