Creating Your First Django App
How Django Works

Before we create our first Django web app, let’s take a little look into how Django works underneath the hood.
The Django project describes itself as an MTV framework, using Models, Templates and Views. Let’s break down these components:

    The model portion deals with data and databases, it can retrieve, store, and change data in a database.
    The template determines how the data looks on a web page.
    The view describes the data to be presented, and passes this information to the template.

With the basics of the components explained let’s understand how they work together when we visit a Django website.
When a request comes to a web server, it’s passed to Django to figure out what is requested.
A client requests a URL, let’s use codecademy.com as an example, Django will take the web address and pass it to its urlresolver.
Django will try to match the URL to a list of patterns, and if there is a match, then pass the request to the associated view function.

Imagine a mail carrier delivering a letter. They walk down the street checking each house number until they find the exact one on the letter.
Once they find the house, they deliver the letter. That’s how the urlresolver works!

When we land on the right page, Django uses data from the model and feeds it into the view function to determine what data is shown.
That data is given to the template and presented to us via the web page.

This is a bit of a simplified version of what Django is doing underneath the hood, but a key takeaway is that Django follows this MTV pattern.
