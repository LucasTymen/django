Creating Your First Django App
Creating a View for an App

Earlier, we discussed the MTV pattern and the integral role that views play.
They are the information brokers in a Django application that decides what data gets delivered to a template and displayed.
More simply put, a view is a class or function that processes a request and sends a response back.

In our veterinarian’s office example website, a customer might go to the /profile page of the website and their request gets passed to a view function to be processed.
The view function may:

    Check to see if the customer is logged in
    Request their profile information from a database
    Format the information in a template
    Send back the profile page as an HTML file for the customer to view in their browser

The view function does quite a bit of work!

At the core, Django uses a protocol called, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the foundation for data communication on the worldwide web.
In Django, requests, and responses are handled as HttpRequest and HttpResponse objects from a module called django.http.

When a page is requested:

    Django creates an HttpRequest object that contains information about the request
    Django loads the appropriate view, passing the HttpRequest as the first argument to the view function

Each view function is responsible for returning an HttpResponse object.
The HttpResponse response object can be the HTML contents of a web page, a redirect, an error, an XML document, an image, or just about anything that can display on a web page.

A simple view function would look like this:

# In views.py
def index(request):
  return HttpResponse("This is the response!")

Above, we have an index() view function for our home page.
When users visit our home page, the view function sends back an HttpResponse with the string "This is the response!" to be displayed on a web page.
Instructions
1.

Import the HttpResponse module from django.http inside views.py.

Add from django.http import HttpResponse at the top of views.py.
2.

Create a function named home() that takes request as an argument.
Return an HttpResponse object with the string "Welcome to the Vet's office!".

Below the import statement, write a function that looks like this:

def home(request):
  return HttpResponse("Here is a response")

============================ view ============================
A simple view function would look like this:

from django.shortcuts import render # <<== Import HttpResponse here

# In views.py
def index(request):
  return HttpResponse("This is the response!")

  exemple :
from django.shortcuts import render
# Import HttpResponse here
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def home(request):
  return HttpResponse("Welcome to the Vet's office!")
